# NFS daemon
My first go at creating linux background service (deamon).

It's only tested on linux mint with fish shell.

log file is saved in `/usr/local/share/nfs-daemon/nfs-daemon.log`.

You can install it by running `./daemonize.fish install` and uninstall it by running `./daemonize.fish uninstall`.

You can retrieve data from it using the `nfs-client` executable. Or any TCP client, just by connecting to the port 2137 and reading the data.

### What it does

Daemon reads data from `/sys/class/net/<your_default_route_interface >/statistics/rx_bytes` and `.../tx_bytes` every second and saves the delta every from the last read.

When you connect to the daemon via TCP, it sends you the data in the format: `RX: <rx-delta>, TX: <tx-delta>` where `<rx-delta>` and `<tx-delta>` are formatted number of bytes received and transmitted in the last second through your default route interface.

That's it.
